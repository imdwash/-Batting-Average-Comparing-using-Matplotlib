# -Batting-Average-Comparing-using-Matplotlib
The visualization was about the averages of four modern great batsman(Steve Smith,Virat Kohli,Kane Willamson,Joe Root) have changed over 10 years. These four are regarded as modern greats and comparing side by sided the averages we can see highs and lows of their careers and we can also see how they have evolved as a player over the years.

The place where there is no bar plot is the year they haven't played. Virat Kohli made test debut in 2011 and Joe root made his in 2012 so there are no bar plot for them in other hand Steve Smith didn't play and single matches in 2012 so there is no bar plot . We can also see Steve Smith has improved his average and Joe Root's average has decline . In other hand Virat Kohli and Kane Willamson has been pretty consistent over the years .
